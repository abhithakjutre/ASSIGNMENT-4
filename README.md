# Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains the solution for Assignment 4, which focuses on file handling, exceptions, and errors in Python.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

**Problem Statement:** Write a Python program that:
1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

**Solution:** `Task1.py`

This script attempts to open and read `sample.txt`. If the file is found, it prints the content line by line. If the file is not found, it prints an error message.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

**Problem Statement:** Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

**Solution:** `Task2.py`

This script prompts the user to enter text, writes it to `output.txt`, and then appends more text to the same file. Finally, it reads and displays the entire content of `output.txt`.
